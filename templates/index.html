<!--h2>Upload HTML5 bundle</h2-->

<h3>About this tool</h3>
<p>This tool makes it easy for you to upload HTML5 creative bundles (.zip files) from Adobe Edge and Google Web Designer to DFP.</p>

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" id="form" action="{{upload_action}}"
      onsubmit="return this.acknowledge.checked">
  <input type="hidden" id="xsrf_token" name="xsrf_token" value="{{xsrf_token|safe}}" />
  <h3>Step 1: Choose your DFP network</h3>
  <p>
    You will see multiple networks in this drop down if you have an
    account in more than one network. Please be sure to choose the
    correct network you with to upload this HTML5 creative bundle to.
  </p>
  <p>
    <select name="network" id="network">
      {% for network in x5_networks %}
      <option value="{{network.code}}">{{network.name}} ({{network.code}})</option>
      {% endfor %}
    </select>
  </p>
  <h3>Step 2: Choose your HTML5 creative bundle (.zip file)</h3>
  <p>
  The tool currently supports Adobe Edge, Google Web Designer and Tumult Hype zip files.
  Other HTML5 creative types will still be processed, but the upload could fail or create
  unexpected problems with the uploaded creative.
  <br />
  We recommend to carefully inspect all uploaded creatives (Edge, Hype, GWD or otherwise)
  before using them on your pages.
  <br />
  Make sure that your creative bundle doesn't contain unsupported assets (e.g. SVG, WebFonts, video
  files), as the tool will discard unsupported assets and the uploaded creative might have rendering
  issues.
  Refer to
    <a href="https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/3163581?hl=en">
      this DFP Help Center article
    </a>
  for supported file types.
  </p>
  <p>
    <input type="file" name="zipfile" id="zipfile" required/>
  </p>
  <h3>Step 3: Upload to the tool</h3>
  <p>
    When you are ready - submit your file which will upload it to our
    servers. We will extract its contents (including any images,
    javascripts etc) and generate some HTML. You will be able to review the
    output before you push to DFP.
